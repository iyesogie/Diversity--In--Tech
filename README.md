According to Reveal, the United States requires an annual submission of employee gender, race/ethnicity,  and job type from all companies with more than 100 employees. (Rangarajan, 2018) Following submission this data was generally private. This project seeks to understand workplace diversity across tech companies in Silicon Valley in 2016 and the shifts in publicly sharing this data. 

Data 
In 2018, Reveal from The Center for Investigative Reporting published a dataset, and the accompanying methodology, of 2016 Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEO) data for 211 tech companies in Silicon Valley. Click here to learn more about Reveal’s methodology.

We used 4 sources for this analysis. 

EEO_2016.csv provides detailed information on gender, race/ethnicity, and job type the companies that said yes in 2016_EEO_Release_Status.csv

2016_EEO_Release_Status.csv provides a list of the 211 that completed the survey. It indicates if 2016 EEO data was publicly shared or not. 

Distributions_data_2016.csv provides percentages for gender, race/ethnicity, and job type for the 211 companies that completed. It does not provide data by name for the companies that did not release their 2016 EEO. 

Transformation & Load
We combined EEO_2016.csv and Distrubutions_data_2016.csv to create our database. Following the cleaning process, the database contained more than 4,000 rows. We then exported the database as a CSV file to create our visuals and analyze the results of three machine learning inquires.

Machine Learning


Three machine learning models are used to classify data into private and public: KneighborsClassifier(KNN), Support Vector Machine Tuning Model(GridSearchCV), Deep Learning Model(Sequencital). Accuracy Score of testing data is 0.714, 0.783, and 0.857 separately. It seems Deep Learning Model shows the best accuray score for testing data.
